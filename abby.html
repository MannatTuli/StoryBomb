        You wake up, you feel very dizzy and your eyes feel heavy. You try and
        move around but your body won't agree, all you can do is breathe right
        now. You try to move head ever so slightly to the left but fail. Now
        panic strikes you and you scream wth all your power, but nothing comes
        out of your mouth. Forcing yourself to be calm you try to hear and work
        out where you are, all you can hear is some water rushing near you and
        you realise you are quite wet. You can feel the sand underneath you and
        figure that you are on some kind of a beach. Trying to move your head
        again you finally succeed, and what you see is horrifying. You are on an
        island and by the look of your clothes have been there for at least a
        week. You see the beach just a couple feet beside you and the ocean blue
        as ever. With all your effort you try to look the other way but can't.
        You decide to wait a couple of minutes before trying again, you believe
        you were given a drug which made your muscles stop responding to your
        brain.
      </p>
      <p class="story">
        After a long 25 minutes you decide to try to move head again and this
        time you do it quite easily, it appears the drug is wearing off. You
        very slowly stand up and look around. There is a forest opposite to the
        beach, which looks so dense that you decide not to go in right now. You
        go towards the water and see a lot of fish near the shore, and think to
        yourself you may have food. Realising the sun is about to set you decide
        to...

      <p class="story storyabby1 hidden">
        You decide to go into the jungle. You run straight into the nearest
        opening and don't stop for the next 10 minutes, when you fins a small
        field in the middle of the jungle. The field is shaped in a circle and
        has five sticks forming a pentagon in the middle. There is a campfire
        burning to the right of you and you see a log placed as if meant to sit
        on. You run over there and see a bag that looks familiar. Inside the bag
        there are some clothes and a bottle of shampoo. You reach for the
        clothes when you hear a twig break.
        <br /><br />
        Instincts kick in and you turn around in a combat position. Both hands
        forming a fist and you are ready to strike as soon as the object reveals
        itself. You expect a raccoon or maybe a bear at most, but what you see
        was nothing of the sort. You see a boy come out of the bushes the same
        age as yours, that's when you recognise him, it's Joe! You start to
        remember how you may have ended up here. Joe shouts at you "Abby!". You
        both hug each other in delight. Joe and you make yourselves comfortable
        on the log near the campfire and Joe begns to speak "I thought you
        didn't make it, I don't think you remember anything but our boat
        crashed. We were going for a vacation, but then a storm hit us. I
        searched for the remains of the boat and other people, but so far no
        luck." You tell him all you remember and he's quite surprised how late
        you woke up "I've been eating fish and drinking coconut water for almost
        4 days now." You both are very tired and decide to turn in for the
        night, Joe shows you the hammock he's made and says you can sleep there
        today he'll find someplace else, you don't argue and take the hammock.
        Waking up Joe is already cooking fish on the campfire, you decide to ask
        him to...

        Walk the beach. You start walking towards the sun and it feels quite
        invigorating, the cold breeze, the sunset and the noise of the ocean all
        relaxes you for a while. You keep walking and forget that you are lost
        on an island without anyone, then you trip on something. You land smack
        on the sand and turn around and see a man lying down. Not able to see
        the face you go closer and you recognise him, it's your friend Joe.
        Delight fills you and start shaking him "Wake up Joe." Finally coming to
        his senses Joe wakes up and cries. You sit him straight and he cries
        "What the hell?" Explaining all that happened to you Joe begins to look
        so worried, you decide to take him to the nearest tree.
        <br /><br />
        You both sit against a tree and start planning how you will get food and
        water. Joe says "Did you find something like a pond or something? I am
        not gonna be drinking ocean water for sure." You reply, "I have'nt been
        in the forest yet, there are fish in the ocean though, so we need not
        worry about food." "That's reassuring, now what do you wanna do? You
        want to catch fish or go look for water?" said Joe. You decide to...

        Show you where he woke up. He says it's not far from here and says to
        follow him. "This is all very, I don't know, sad?" says Joe. "Could not
        agree more." you reply. Walking for another 5 minutes you reach the
        shore, there is some blood smothered on the rocks here and you ask "Is
        this your blood? Are you hurt Joe?" "Oh no, I used the bandages I
        packed, it was just a small cut on my stomach." Joe replied. "This is
        nice, the sunrise and the ocean breeze." you say happily. "Isn't it?"
        you add. "Joe come on dude." No response. You turn around and see Joe
        still as a statue, get crushed by a boat which is coming towards you
        now. Filled with emotion you try to run, but fail.

        Explore the jungle with you. "Alright, but we need to be careful I am
        pretty sure I have heard something like a bear twice already." You pick
        up the thickest stick you can find and Joe takes out his knife, and you
        both go inside the forest.After about an hour of non stop walking, you
        both decide to take a rest, as you go to sit down Joe shouts, "Abby
        cmere!" You run towards him and freeze. Joe turns around, and you both
        look at each other horrified. There is a wall covered in vines, with two
        lines written on it in red,"Where this commenced is where it shall end.
        Vern rout the place."

        Catch fish. You walk towards the ocean to see if the fish are still
        there and fortunately they are. You run towards the jungle to get make a
        hook to catch the fish. As you are running you feel the air get denser,
        you start to feel heavy and you fall down. You try to look up and see
        Joe laughing at you.

        look for water. You go into the jungle, you are quite scared what may
        come at you but you try not to think about it. As you go deeper into the
        forest you start panicking that you have lost. Tired, you take a break
        and sit down on the ground in between two gigantic trees. As you sit
        down, you see smoke coming from deeper from the forest, before you know
        it you start to feel the heat, you can hear the fire rushing towards you
        like waves. You turn around and try to run , but fail to outrun the
        nature.
