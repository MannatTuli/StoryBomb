        In America, a bald tall man picks up a the phone, "Bertham speaking,"
        "It's done" says the voice on the phone. "Good job."
        <br /><br />
        Election day has come close, unfortunate for Bertham, Abby is the
        favourite, Bertham does not like losing, maybe this is what made him
        kill the last leader of the largest gang in America "The golden Tiger"
        and overtake him. His word nowadays is everyone's command. On the
        election day, Abby made a mistake and took a boat with only 2 bodyguards
        to reach New York for some businness. All Bertham needs is a small error
        to pounce on someone and Abby had provided him with that. Joe, his
        special agent and the top lieutenant of the gang himself carried out the
        mission, crashing the boat and Abby's dream to become the president.
        America was going to suffer.
