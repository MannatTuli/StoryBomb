    <h3>Epilogue (Wall Riddle)...</h3>

        <br />
        You figure the wall is some sort of a riddle. You decide to break down
        the riddle and then try to understand it. "Where this commenced", you
        thought this was quite explanotary and that we have to go to where this
        all started which is either where Joe was found or you were. The next
        words tricked you a bit at first "Vern rout". Joe comes in for the
        rescue and realises that this is an anagram for "turn over". Turn over
        the place where you started. You both run to each's respective spots and
        start digging. Both find a key and suddenly fall to the ground. You are
        shaking and think this is an earthquake, you fall unconcious.
        <br /><br />
        You wake up, you are in a room full of wires. You feel tired, but you
        know all this was not the reality, it was what they call "Virtual
        Reality brought to the next level." You have to lie down in the so
        called "box" and it takes you to any place you want with whoever you
        want. Finally in you tiny apartment, you sit down on the dining table
        and look around, your playstation, 2 beanbags and a couch are exactly
        where they were. Relaxed you ake yourself a bowl of cereal and enjoy the
        live fifa footage.
